# Machine-Learning---Tumour-Identification

Machine learning algorithms on a breast cancer dataset to identify if a tumour is malignant or benign

1. Explored Machine Learning techniques on the breast cancer dataset to build algorithms to predict whether a tumour is malignant or benign.
2. The performance of supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree were compared.
3. The effects of feature engineering using PCA and Pearsonâ€™s correlation matrix and the effects of data engineering using under sampling and over sampling were also studied .
